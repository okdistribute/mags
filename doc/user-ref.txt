Outline: 

Note: I want to add in terminology as I write the documentation.
	It will be much easier to intuitively put definitions
	into the writing while I'm writing because I'll know
	when I need to use a new word. However, I am also
	trying to include them into the outline.

Chapter 1: Overview
	What is MAGS? 
	Contact Information
	SRFI :64 Information
	
Chapter 2: First Test Suites
	Terminology: 
		test-suites
	Basic file structure for a test
		give a layout for a basic example
		give an example using length recursive proc.

	Expand the length into a 3 question submission
		explain how to either put in one file (ew)
			or use scheme's handy include, etc
		separate files for test cases for each problem

Chapter 3: Advanced Test Suites
	Custom ADTs

Chapter 4: CLI Interface, Running MAGS, etc

leave for reference purposes

Chapter 2: Test Suites
	Basic Structure
	Custom ADTS

Chapter 3: Grading the actual assignment
	Arguments, structure, etc

Chapter 4: Not Sure as of yet.


Index: 
	Can be beginning or end. Not completely neccesary, but helpful

Other things to address in Docs:
	Sandboxes
		the one under which to grade
		virtual filesystem (for future)
	Testing
		list of SRFI testing procedures used in MAGS
			so that somebody doesn't have to train
			another person to write test suites for 
			MAGS.


Questions:
	How to make the test files? test cases? terminology?
	How to grade the assignment?
	Why does it matter why we include or load the files
		that we want to use (in regards to SRFI :64)?
	Ticks in scheme? <------Infinite Loop Problem

Problems to address:
	test-eventually doesn't stop
		if requirements aren't met, it just keeps going
	infinite loop problem
