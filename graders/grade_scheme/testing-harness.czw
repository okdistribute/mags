@* Introduction. This file describes the testing harness environment
which is used to evaluate and load test-suites. The basic environment 
can be described by the following library declaration. (XXX: This thing
needs a whole lot more documentations!)


@(testing-harness.sls@>=
(library (mags autograder grade_scheme testing-harness)
  (export 
    test-suite
    test-group
    test-assert
    test-equal
    test-set
    test-eqv
    test-eq
    test-approx
    test-load
    test-begin test-end

  (include "testing-harness.ss"))

@* Time limiting evaluation.
This section defines |with-time-limit|, a procedure that evaluates thunk,
using a low-level timer to limit the execution time. It is meant to be safe for
use with all standard (non-FFI) Scheme forms, including engines. It uses Chez
Scheme's low-level signal handling interface, so code using this form should
not rely on or use this interface for other purposes. The syntax is as follows:

\medskip\verbatim
(with-time-limit seconds handler-thunk proc-thunk)
!endverbatim\medskip

\noindent The |proc-thunk| is evaluated with a time limit, and a signal handler
is registered before executing |proc-thunk| that will call the |handler-thunk|
if the execution time exceeds the time limit and return the value returned by 
the |handler-thunk|.

@c () => (with-time-limit)
@<Time Limiting Procedure@>=
(define signal/alarm 14) ; Magic constant 14 from signal.h
(define $alarm (foreign-procedure "alarm" (unsigned-int) unsigned-int))
(define (with-time-limit seconds handler-thunk proc-thunk)
  (call-with-current-continuation 
    (lambda (return)
      (register-signal-handler signal/alarm (lambda (x) (return (handler-thunk))))
      ($alarm seconds)
      (proc-thunk))))
  
@ The above code relies on the foreign |alarm(2)| function which we import
from the standard C library.

@c () => ()
@<Load shared libraries@>=
(load-shared-object "libc.so.6")
